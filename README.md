# 🌾 Crop Recommendation System

## 🌟 Overview
The **Crop Recommendation System** is a machine learning-powered application designed to assist farmers and agriculturists in determining the most suitable crop to cultivate based on soil and weather conditions. By inputting data such as soil nutrients and environmental parameters, users receive instant recommendations on the optimal crop to plant.

## 🚀 Features
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easily input soil and weather parameters for immediate crop recommendations.
- **Machine Learning Model**: Uses a **Decision Tree Classifier** for precise crop predictions.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Displays model accuracy and performance metrics for better understanding.
- **Web-Based Deployment**: Built using **Streamlit** for seamless user interaction.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: For efficient data handling and analysis.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning library for model implementation.
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization.
- **Streamlit**: To create an interactive web application.

## 📦 Dataset
The model is trained on the `Crop_recommendation.csv` dataset, which includes:
- **N**: Nitrogen content in soil
- **P**: Phosphorus content in soil
- **K**: Potassium content in soil
- **Temperature**: Average temperature (°C)
- **Humidity**: Relative humidity (%)
- **pH**: Soil acidity level
- **Rainfall**: Annual rainfall (mm)

## 📈 Model Performance
The **Decision Tree Classifier** achieves high accuracy in recommending the best crop based on input parameters. Users can check the model's performance through accuracy metrics displayed in the application.

## 🔧 Installation and Usage
### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Vikashchaurasiya07/Crop-Recommendation-System.git
cd Crop-Recommendation-System
```

### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies:
Ensure Python is installed, then run:
